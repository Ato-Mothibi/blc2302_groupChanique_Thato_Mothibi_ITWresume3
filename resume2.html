            <p>It is important to take care of the patient, to be followed 
                by the doctor, but it is a time of great pain and suffering. 
                For to come to the smallest detail, no one should practice any 
                kind of work unless he derives some benefit from it. Do not be 
                angry with the pain in the reprimand in the pleasure he wants 
                to be a hair from the pain in the hope that there is no breeding. 
                Unless they are blinded by lust, they do not come out; they are 
                in fault who abandon their duties and soften their hearts, that is toil.</p>
